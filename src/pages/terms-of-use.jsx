                      provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of
                      Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
                      of any remaining provisions.

                      provision or any other provision and our failure to assert
                      any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not
                      constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
